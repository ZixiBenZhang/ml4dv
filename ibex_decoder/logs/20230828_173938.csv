------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRL: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRL.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 0.
- LB_x_read_A_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the read_A port of register 3.
- XOR_x_read_A_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the read_A port of register 1.
- XOR_x_write_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the write port of register 6.
- read_A_reg_23: there's no instruction that uses the read_A port of register 3.
------

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRL: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRL.
- OR_x_read_B_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_B port of register 1.
- SRL_x_write_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the write port of register 9.
- ADDI_x_read_A_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the read_A port of register 1.
- OR_x_read_B_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_B port of register 0.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 4.

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRL: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRL.
- SLLI_x_write_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the write port of register 8.
- SLL_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the write port of register 4.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 2.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 6.
- SW_x_read_B_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_B port of register 3.

128,2,106,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRL: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRL.
- SRLI_x_write_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 3.
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 2.
- SLT_x_read_A_reg_12: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the read_A port of register 2.
- OR_x_write_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the write port of register 8.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

141,3,10,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- XORI_x_write_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the write port of register 9.
- SLTUI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the write port of register 7.
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 9.
- SLTUI_x_write_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the write port of register 5.
- AND_x_write_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the write port of register 2.
- SLL_x_read_B_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_B port of register 0.
- SUB_x_write_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the write port of register 3.
------

142,3,11,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- ADDI_x_write_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the write port of register 6.
- LB_x_read_A_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the read_A port of register 3.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 4.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_1: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 1.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 9.
- ORI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the write port of register 7.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 9.

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 1.
- SUB_x_write_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the write port of register 3.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_2: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 2.
- SRA_x_write_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 6.
- ADDI_x_write_reg_15: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the write port of register 5.

151,3,20,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLL_x_read_A_reg_12: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_A port of register 2.
- SLT_x_write_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the write port of register 0.
- SRLI_x_write_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 3.
- ANDI_x_write_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the write port of register 3.
- SLT_x_write_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the write port of register 9.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 9.
- LW_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation LW using the read_A port of register 4.
------

153,3,22,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SRA_x_read_A_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_A port of register 1.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 5.
- OR_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the write port of register 7.
- LH_x_write_reg_8: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the write port of register 8.
- SRL_x_write_reg_8: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the write port of register 8.
- LH_x_write_reg_2: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the write port of register 2.
- SLTI_x_write_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the write port of register 5.
------

158,3,27,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SH_x_read_A_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 0.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 1.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 2.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 4.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 9.
- LB_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the read_A port of register 9.
- SRA_x_read_A_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_A port of register 6.

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRA_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 1.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 1.
- ANDI_x_write_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the write port of register 0.
- LB_x_read_A_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the read_A port of register 1.
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 9.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

177,4,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 4.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 3.
- SLLI_x_write_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the write port of register 9.
- SLTUI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the write port of register 7.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 4.

178,4,6,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLTI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the write port of register 7.
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 4.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 0.
- LH_x_write_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the write port of register 9.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_8: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 8.
- XORI_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the read_A port of register 4.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 7.

182,4,10,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- OR_x_write_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the write port of register 7.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 4.
- SLL_x_read_B_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_B port of register 4.
- XOR_x_write_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the write port of register 6.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 4.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_12: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 2.
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 1.
------

185,4,13,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SRLI_x_write_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 8.
- LH_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the read_A port of register 1.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 7.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 0.
- OR_x_write_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the write port of register 9.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 1.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 5.

191,4,19,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SRLI_x_write_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 1.
- ADDI_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the write port of register 1.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 5.
- SLL_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_A port of register 1.
- SLTUI_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the write port of register 4.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 7.
- ORI_x_write_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the write port of register 1.

192,4,20,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 7.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 9.
- SLTU_x_read_A_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_A port of register 3.
- LW_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation LW using the write port of register 7.
- SW_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_A port of register 4.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00c38333, 0x00e1e533, 0x00c38333, 0x0031a503, 0x00b38333, 0x00e38303,

193,4,21,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 6.
- XOR_x_write_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the write port of register 3.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 4.
- ORI_x_read_A_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the read_A port of register 3.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_2: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 2.
------

194,4,22,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRA_x_write_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 5.
- SLTI_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the write port of register 1.
- SLL_x_write_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the write port of register 6.
- ORI_x_write_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the write port of register 8.
- XOR_x_read_B_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the read_B port of register 7.
------

UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 6.
- SUB_x_read_B_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_B port of register 0.
- AND_x_write_reg_1: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the write port of register 1.
- SLTI_x_write_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the write port of register 2.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 7.

Here are some of the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- LW_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation LW using the read_A port of register 4.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 0.
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SLL_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_A port of register 4.
- XOR_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the read_A port of register 1.
- SB_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_A port of register 6.
- ORI_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the write port of register 7.

205,4,33,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLTUI_x_read_A_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the read_A port of register 7.
- LB_x_read_A_reg_10: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the read_A port of register 0.
- SLTI_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the write port of register 7.
- SUBI_x_read_A_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the read_A port of register 3.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_8: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 8.
- OR_x_write_reg_15: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the write port of register 5.
- OR_x_read_B_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_B port of register 0.

207,4,35,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SW_x_read_B_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_B port of register 9.
- ADDI_x_write_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the write port of register 9.
- SLLI_x_write_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the write port of register 5.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 5.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 4.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00c30333, 0x00d30333, 0x00004033, 0x40130333, 0x00001093, 0x00001033, 0x00630333,

208,4,36,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 9.
- SRA_x_read_B_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_B port of register 7.
- SUB_x_read_B_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_B port of register 3.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 0.
- SRAI_x_write_reg_10: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the write port of register 0.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

211,5,3,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- XORI_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the read_A port of register 1.
- LW_x_read_A_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation LW using the read_A port of register 0.
- SB_x_read_B_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_B port of register 7.
- AND_x_write_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the write port of register 4.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 1.
- SLTUI_x_read_A_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the read_A port of register 4.
- ADDI_x_read_A_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the read_A port of register 1.

212,5,4,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SUBI_x_write_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 6.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 9.
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SB_x_read_B_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_B port of register 0.
- SRAI_x_write_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the write port of register 5.
- SB_x_read_A_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_A port of register 4.
- SRLI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 7.

213,5,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_12: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 2.
- ADD_x_write_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation ADD using the write port of register 7.
- SLTI_x_read_A_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the read_A port of register 8.
- SLTUI_x_write_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the write port of register 9.
- LW_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation LW using the write port of register 7.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 7.
- SW_x_read_B_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_B port of register 7.
------

214,5,6,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 4.
- SUB_x_write_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the write port of register 1.
- ADDI_x_read_A_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SLTUI_x_read_A_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the read_A port of register 5.
- SLL_x_read_A_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_A port of register 2.
- SLT_x_read_A_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the read_A port of register 7.
- SRA_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_A port of register 6.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

219,6,4,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SLTU_x_read_A_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_A port of register 3.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 0.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 2.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 0.
- SLTU_x_read_A_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_A port of register 5.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00000033, 0x00000013, 0x00000013, 0x00000013, 0x00000013, 0x00000013, 0x00000013,

220,6,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 3.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 3.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 4.
- SRAI_x_write_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the write port of register 2.
- SLLI_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the write port of register 7.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 1.
- SLL_x_write_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the write port of register 6.

221,6,6,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLL_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the write port of register 1.
- ORI_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the read_A port of register 6.
- AND_x_write_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the write port of register 6.
- ADDI_x_read_A_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the read_A port of register 3.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 1.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 0.
- SLL_x_read_A_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_A port of register 1.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 7.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 5.
- SB_x_read_A_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_A port of register 7.
- XORI_x_read_A_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the read_A port of register 0.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 7.

230,7,8,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 1.
- XORI_x_write_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the write port of register 5.
- SRLI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 7.
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 7.
------

231,7,9,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SLL_x_write_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the write port of register 8.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 8.
- XORI_x_read_A_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the read_A port of register 3.
- SRA_x_read_B_reg_10: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_B port of register 0.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 9.
------

232,7,10,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLTU_x_read_A_reg_15: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_A port of register 5.
- SUB_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the write port of register 3.
- SLTU_x_read_B_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_B port of register 0.
- ANDI_x_write_reg_15: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the write port of register 5.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 5.
- XOR_x_read_B_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the read_B port of register 8.
- SRA_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 3.

------
UNREACHED BINS
- SW_x_read_B_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_B port of register 4.
- SRL_x_write_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the write port of register 0.
- LB_x_read_A_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the read_A port of register 5.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 2.
- LH_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the write port of register 4.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 4.
- SB_x_read_B_reg_1: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_B port of register 1.

237,7,15,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 0.
- SRLI_x_write_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 9.
- SLTU_x_read_B_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_B port of register 7.
- SRL_x_write_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the write port of register 5.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_8: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 8.

238,7,16,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SB_x_read_B_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_B port of register 8.
- SUB_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the write port of register 4.
- SLT_x_write_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the write port of register 6.
- SLTUI_x_write_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTUI using the write port of register 7.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 9.
------

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SLL_x_write_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the write port of register 4.
- ANDI_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the write port of register 1.
- SW_x_read_B_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_B port of register 7.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 4.
- ANDI_x_write_reg_1: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the write port of register 1.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

242,8,3,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- OR_x_read_A_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 3.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 8.
- SRLI_x_write_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the write port of register 4.
- SLTI_x_read_A_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the read_A port of register 6.
- XORI_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SB_x_read_A_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_A port of register 9.
- SLTU_x_read_A_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_A port of register 1.

243,8,4,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 4.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_15: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 5.
- SLTU_x_write_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the write port of register 8.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_10: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 0.
- ORI_x_read_A_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the read_A port of register 8.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 0.
- SLTU_x_read_B_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_B port of register 1.

246,8,7,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- LH_x_read_A_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the read_A port of register 0.
- SUBI_x_read_A_reg_15: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the read_A port of register 5.
- SLTI_x_read_A_reg_12: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the read_A port of register 2.
- ADDI_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation ADDI using the read_A port of register 1.
- SB_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_A port of register 9.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00c30333, 0x00830333, 0x0000b423, 0x0040a533, 0x00a3a533, 0x0020a533, 0x00a30323,

------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

250,9,4,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- ANDI_x_read_A_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation ANDI using the read_A port of register 9.
- SLLI_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the write port of register 4.
- SLTI_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTI using the write port of register 7.
- SRL_x_read_A_reg_17: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_A port of register 7.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 9.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00000133, 0x00000233, 0x00000333, 0x00000433, 0x00000533, 0x00000633, 0x00000733,

251,9,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 6.
- SRL_x_read_B_reg_20: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the read_B port of register 0.
- ADD_x_read_A_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation ADD using the read_A port of register 1.
- XORI_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation XORI using the write port of register 3.
- XOR_x_read_B_reg_28: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the read_B port of register 8.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00000133, 0x00000233, 0x00000333, 0x00000433, 0x00000533, 0x00000633, 0x00000733,

254,9,8,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND_x_read_A_reg_19: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 9.
- SLT_x_read_B_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the read_B port of register 2.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 4.
- SLTU_x_read_B_reg_31: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_B port of register 1.
- AND_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_A port of register 6.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 5.
- SB_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation SB using the read_A port of register 1.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SUB_x_read_B_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_B port of register 8.
- LB_x_write_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the write port of register 8.
- ORI_x_write_reg_30: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the write port of register 0.
- SUBI_x_read_A_reg_10: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the read_A port of register 0.
- LB_x_write_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the write port of register 9.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00c30333, 0x00c303d3, 0x00c30373, 0x00c30333, 0x00c30373, 0x00c30353, 0x00c30333,

258,10,4,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRA_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 3.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 6.
- SLT_x_read_A_reg_14: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the read_A port of register 4.
- SLT_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the write port of register 4.
- SUBI_x_read_A_reg_8: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the read_A port of register 8.
------
Please regenerate a 32-bit instruction for each of these unreached bins according to the BINS DESCRIPTION.""","""[0x00c30333, 0x00c303d3, 0x00c30373, 0x00c30333, 0x00c30373, 0x00c30353, 0x00c30333,

259,10,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- AND_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the write port of register 3.
- SLTU_x_read_B_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_B port of register 8.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 1.
- SLL_x_read_B_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_B port of register 7.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 5.
------

- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SLLI_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the write port of register 4.
- SUB_x_read_A_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_A port of register 7.
- AND_x_read_B_reg_10: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 0.
- SLT_x_read_B_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the read_B port of register 9.
- SLT_x_write_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the write port of register 5.

261,10,7,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- ORI_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the write port of register 1.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

266,11,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 8.
- SRAI_x_write_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the write port of register 2.
- SLTU_x_read_B_reg_26: there's no operation that performs the operation SLTU using the read_B port of register 6.
- LB_x_write_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the write port of register 1.
- SLLI_x_read_A_reg_6: there's no operation that performs the operation SLLI using the read_A port of register 6.

267,11,6,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 7.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_27: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 7.
- OR_x_read_A_reg_25: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the read_A port of register 5.
- LH_x_read_A_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the read_A port of register 1.
- ORI_x_read_A_reg_16: there's no operation that performs the operation ORI using the read_A port of register 6.
------

268,11,7,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- XOR_x_write_reg_2: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the write port of register 2.
- SRL_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SRL using the write port of register 3.
- XOR_x_write_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation XOR using the write port of register 3.
- SRA_x_read_B_reg_3: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_B port of register 3.
- SRA_x_write_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 9.

BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD: addition between two register files
    - ADDI: addition between a register file and an immediate (i.e. a constant number)
    - SUB: subtraction between two register files
    - SUBI: subtraction between a register file and an immediate
    - AND: logical operation AND between two register files
    - ANDI: logical operation AND between a register file and an immediate
    - OR: logical operation OR between two register files
    - ORI: logical operation OR between a register file and an immediate
    - XOR: logical operation XOR between two register files
    - XORI: logical operation XOR between a register file and an immediate
    - SLL: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SLLI: logical shift left a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRL: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRLI: logical shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SRA: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to another register file
    - SRAI: arithmetic shift right a register file by number of bits equal to an immediate
    - SLT: make comparison between two register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTI: make comparison between a register file and an immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTU: make comparison between two unsigned register files; if the first one is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - SLTUI: make comparison between an unsigned register file and an unsigned immediate; if the register file is smaller, write 1 to a register file, otherwise write 0
    - LW: load a word (a 32-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LH: load a half-word (a 16-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - LB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from memory at the address equal to a register file into a register file
    - SW: store a word (a 32-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SH: store a half-word (a 16-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
    - SB: load a byte (an 8-bit value) from a register file to memory at the address equal to a register file
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports (""read_A"" and ""read_B"") and a write port (""write"")
    - ""read_A"" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - ""read_B"" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - ""write"" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

271,12,3,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- SLT_x_write_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SLT using the write port of register 9.
- LW_x_write_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation LW using the write port of register 2.
- SRA_x_write_reg_18: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the write port of register 8.
- SRLI_x_read_A_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SRLI using the read_A port of register 2.
- OR_x_write_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation OR using the write port of register 7.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_11: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 1.
- SRA_x_read_B_reg_29: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_B port of register 9.

273,12,5,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS

274,12,6,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND_x_read_B_reg_0: there's no operation that performs the operation AND using the read_B port of register 0.
- SRAI_x_read_A_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation SRAI using the read_A port of register 4.
- LB_x_write_reg_13: there's no operation that performs the operation LB using the write port of register 3.
- SLL_x_read_B_reg_5: there's no operation that performs the operation SLL using the read_B port of register 5.
- SUBI_x_write_reg_24: there's no operation that performs the operation SUBI using the write port of register 4.
- SUB_x_read_B_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SUB using the read_B port of register 3.
- LH_x_write_reg_21: there's no operation that performs the operation LH using the write port of register 1.
------

275,12,7,"""The new values you just provided didn't cover any new bins. You need to try to cover as much of the described bins as you can.
You will see the result coverage of your previous response(s), and then generate another list of 32-bit instructions to cover the unreached bins (i.e. test cases)
Here are some of  the unreached bins:
------
UNREACHED BINS
- AND: there's no instruction that performs the operation AND.
- SRA: there's no instruction that performs the operation SRA.
- SRA_x_read_A_reg_9: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_A port of register 9.
- SH_x_read_B_reg_7: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_B port of register 7.
- SW_x_read_B_reg_4: there's no operation that performs the operation SW using the read_B port of register 4.
- SH_x_read_A_reg_22: there's no operation that performs the operation SH using the read_A port of register 2.
- SRA_x_read_A_reg_23: there's no operation that performs the operation SRA using the read_A port of register 3.
