Content: You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a RISC-V instruction decoder. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) to cover these test cases.

----------
Now, we want to test the instruction decoder with a list of 32-bit instructions as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD
    - ADDI
    - SUB
    - SUBI
    - AND
    - ANDI
    - OR
    - ORI
    - XOR
    - XORI
    - SLL
    - SLLI
    - SRL
    - SRLI
    - SRA
    - SRAI
    - SLT
    - SLTI
    - SLTU
    - SLTUI
    - LW
    - LH
    - LB
    - SW
    - SH
    - SB
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports ("read_A" and "read_B") and a write port ("write")
    - "read_A" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - "read_B" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - "write" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

------

----------
Following the bins description, generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) which covers the described bins as much as you can.

Content: You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a RISC-V instruction decoder. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) to cover these test cases.

----------
Now, we want to test the instruction decoder with a list of 32-bit instructions as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD
    - ADDI
    - SUB
    - SUBI
    - AND
    - ANDI
    - OR
    - ORI
    - XOR
    - XORI
    - SLL
    - SLLI
    - SRL
    - SRLI
    - SRA
    - SRAI
    - SLT
    - SLTI
    - SLTU
    - SLTUI
    - LW
    - LH
    - LB
    - SW
    - SH
    - SB
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports ("read_A" and "read_B") and a write port ("write")
    - "read_A" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - "read_B" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - "write" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

------

----------
Following the bins description, generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) which covers the described bins as much as you can.

Content: You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a RISC-V instruction decoder. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) to cover these test cases.

----------
Now, we want to test the instruction decoder with a list of 32-bit instructions as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD
    - ADDI
    - SUB
    - SUBI
    - AND
    - ANDI
    - OR
    - ORI
    - XOR
    - XORI
    - SLL
    - SLLI
    - SRL
    - SRLI
    - SRA
    - SRAI
    - SLT
    - SLTI
    - SLTU
    - SLTUI
    - LW
    - LH
    - LB
    - SW
    - SH
    - SB
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports ("read_A" and "read_B") and a write port ("write")
    - "read_A" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - "read_B" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - "write" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

------

----------
Following the bins description, generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) which covers the described bins as much as you can.

Content: You will receive a description of bins (i.e. test cases) of a testbench for a hardware device under test (DUT), which is a RISC-V instruction decoder. Then, you are going to generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) to cover these test cases.

----------
Now, we want to test the instruction decoder with a list of 32-bit instructions as its input. We want the input to cover the bins (i.e. test cases) that we care about. Here's the description of the bins that we care about:
------
BINS DESCRIPTION
- The list contains 32-bit hexadecimal integers, each represents a RISC-V instruction.
- There are 32 register files available, with index from 0 to 31.
- There are 26 available types of operations:
---
OPERATIONS
    - ADD
    - ADDI
    - SUB
    - SUBI
    - AND
    - ANDI
    - OR
    - ORI
    - XOR
    - XORI
    - SLL
    - SLLI
    - SRL
    - SRLI
    - SRA
    - SRAI
    - SLT
    - SLTI
    - SLTU
    - SLTUI
    - LW
    - LH
    - LB
    - SW
    - SH
    - SB
---
- BIN type 1: For each operation, the list contains at least one instruction that performs it.

- Each of the 32 register files has two read ports ("read_A" and "read_B") and a write port ("write")
    - "read_A" is used when the register file is taken as the first argument of an operation.
    - "read_B" is used when the register file is taken as the second argument of an operation.
    - "write" is used when the result of an operation is written to the register file.
- BIN type 2: For each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that uses it.

- BIN type 3: For each operation and each register file port, the list contains at least one instruction that performs the operation and uses the port as the same time.

------

----------
Following the bins description, generate a list of 32-bit instructions (i.e. hex integers between 0x0 and 0xffffffff) which covers the described bins as much as you can.
